# Expense Tracker

Hi! This is a finance app I made to help people track their bills, incomes, and expenses.

[View a demo](https://expensetracker.website/)

## Technologies

This application uses React, Next.js, Redux, and Typescript for the front-end. I built the back-end with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Pre-Requisites

### Install Yarn

Please install Yarn if you do not already have it installed:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

## Architecture

The application will be divided into microfrontends (applications). The **container** contains all of the website's source code.

## Adding New Features

Please create a separate branch to edit the code.

The following command is an example of creating a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch-name
```

Please **do not** push to the main or master branches.
